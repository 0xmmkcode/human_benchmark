    // Personality quiz data - read-only for all users
    match /personality_questions/{document} {
      allow read: if true;

    }
    
    match /personality_scale/{document} {

    match /aggregates/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
    
    // User results - users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId}/personalityResults/{resultId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
